Once the brain\u2019s reward system has been impacted by the addictive substance or activity, it can trigger a behavioral and biological response that promotes repeated engagement in the addictive behavior despite harmful consequences.",

Multiple factors influence this process, including genetics, diet, mental health, past traumas, pain, stress, and stage of life.",
            "An intervention is one of several strategies used to persuade an addicted person to get help for their addiction. Interventions are an organized attempt by family members or friends to confront a loved one about how their addictive behavior has affected them.

The impact of genetics is influenced by an interaction between a person's environment, diet, and biology. Alcoholism, like other addictions, tends to run in families, and members of those families are at increased risk for developing alcoholism.",
            "The first step in overcoming addiction is to desire change and avoid the people, places and things which promote the addiction. Support groups, mentors, and 12 step programs provide help, while counselors, recovery centers, and physicians provide expertise and medication to treat cravings and the effects of withdrawal. Eating healthy and getting exercise also play an important role in recovery."
