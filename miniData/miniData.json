            "\u201cThe majority of those medications are aimed at calming down the neurons and preventing the electrical activity from spreading abnormally,\u201d Mariwalla says. \u201cThe problem with some of these medications is they can be toxic to the body. Sometimes they can literally slow you down in general. But we\u2019ve come up with some really great medicines that are well-tolerated, that we can start in younger and younger populations, and that can be very effective and, obviously, lifesaving.\u201d",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say,\u201d says Mariwalla. \u201cI think he would probably be classified under sudden, unexpected death in epilepsy. It goes by an acronym called SUDEP. It\u2019s basically a grab bag diagnosis. It means that somebody with epilepsy died unexpectedly and there\u2019s no toxicological or anatomical cause of death during the autopsy. It\u2019s sort of a non-answer answer. We\u2019re just saying what it is, it\u2019s a sudden death in a patient who has epilepsy. It does not describe the cause of death.\u201d",

They come in all different forms.\u201d",
            "\u201cWhen you have a seizure, you can go into a state called status epilepticus,\u201d Mariwalla says. \u201cStatus epilepticus is where you\u2019re continually having seizures. In other words, the seizure doesn\u2019t break. When that happens, you build up some very toxic metabolites in the brain that can make the brain swell. Your brain requires immense amounts of oxygen and glucose to continue firing away like that, and you can in a sense burn out your brain.\u201d",
            "The problem, Mariwalla explains, is that there are many different ways that a seizure can lead to death, and they can be hard to sort out postmortem.",
            "Brain swelling can also occur when the patient\u2019s airway is blocked, and they have difficulty breathing, a common side effect of a seizure.",

            "For those that have over 20 seizures a day, they often opt for an extremely difficult but life-saving brain surgery to remove the part of the brain that is causing the seizures. But for others, they can manage it with medication.",
            "\u201cIn a basic way, we think about epilepsy as a misfiring of the nervous system, of the brain cells,\u201d Mariwalla says. \u201cMost brain cells are meant to do is fire off electrical signals in meaningful patterns. Even as we develop memories, those memories are formed from repeated, patterned firing of neurons. What happens with epilepsy is you basically get a misfiring or a spread of that electricity which then fires off all the surrounding neurons.\u201d",

People are diagnosed with epilepsy if they have had two or more unprovoked seizures, meaning those who have had a seizure from other conditions \u2014 such as low blood sugar, overheating or alcohol withdrawal \u2014 do not qualify.",

He says in some cases, epilepsy patients self-medicate with over the counter drugs, which can interfere with seizure medications and their ability to prevent seizure.",

And I had to go and say [to director James Cameron], 'Look Jim, I'm going to pull it back the next one. I think I just had to get one of those out. This is a special moment.' It was really fun for my wife as well. She is a grounded, wonderful woman and mother. But when she got to that set and saw Ollie up there she lost it as well. We were just both bubbling with tears.

            "Analyst Cheong Seong-Chang at the private Sejong Institute in South Korea said if Kim continues to take this daughter to key public events, that could signal that she would become Kim's successor.",
            "The North's state media said Saturday that Kim had observed the launch of its new type of intercontinental ballistic missile with his wife Ri Sol Ju, their \"beloved daughter\" and other officials the previous day. Kim said the launch of the Hwasong-17 missile \u2014 the North's longest-range, nuclear-capable missile \u2014 proved he has a reliable weapon to contain U.S.-led military threats.",
            "Much of Kim's private life is still unknown. But South Korean media reported Kim married Ri, a former singer, in 2009, and that the couple have three children who were born in 2010, 2013 and 2017.",
            "The Kim family has governed North Korea with a strong personality following built around key family members since Kim's grandfather, Kim Il Sung, founded the country in 1948. The family's so-called Paektu bloodline, named after the North's most sacred mountain, allows only direct family members to rule the country.",
            "\"This may be an attempt to compensate for how few economic accomplishments Kim has to support his domestic legitimacy,\" Easley said.",
            "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 North Korea has unveiled the little-known daughter of its leader Kim Jong Un at a missile launch site, attracting keen attention on a fourth-generation member of the dynastic family that has ruled North Korea for more than seven decades.",
            "This photo provided on Nov. 19, 2022, by the North Korean government shows its leader Kim Jong Un, accompanied by his wife Ri Sol Ju, second from right, and his daughter, as Kim inspects the test firing of what it says a Hwasong-17 intercontinental ballistic missile in Pyongyang, North Korea, on Friday.",
            "It wasn't known which child Kim took to the launch site. But in 2013, after a trip to Pyongyang, retired NBA star Dennis Rodman told the British newspaper the Guardian that he and Kim had a \"relaxing time by the sea\" with the leader's family and that he held Kim's baby daughter, named Ju Ae.",
            "The Associated Press",
            "This photo provided on Nov. 19, 2022 by the North Korean government shows North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and his daughter inspect the site of a missile launch at Pyongyang International Airport in Pyongyang, North Korea, on Friday.",
            "The disclosure of the Kim family child has taken many North Korea watchers by surprise.",

            "\"Under North Korea's system, the children of Kim Jong Un would have the status of a prince or princess, like in a dynasty. As the Rodong Sinmnum newspaper publicized the photo of the daughter, who took after Kim Jong Un and Ri Sol Ju so much ... she has no choice but to live special lives,\" Cheong said.",
            "The main Rodong Sinmun newspaper also released a slew of photos of Kim watching a soaring missile from a distance with his daughter. Other photos showed her with her hair pulled back, wearing a white coat and a pair of red shoes as she walked in hand-in-hand with her father by a huge missile atop a launch truck.",
            "Other observers say Kim taking his family to a missile test site indicated he was confident in the weapon's successful launch, or that he might have tried to burnish an image as a normal leader including his family in his affairs.",
            "\"It's much too soon to infer anything about succession within the Kim regime,\" said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul. \"However, publicly including his wife and daughter in what Kim claims as a historically successful missile test associates the family business of ruling North Korea with the nation's missile programs.\"",
            "The identities of Kim's children are a source of strong outside interest as the 38-year-old ruler hasn't publicly anointed an heir apparent.",
            "But Cheong said Kim Jong Il privately told associates in 1992 that Kim Jong Un, his third and youngest son, would succeed him. Cheong said Kim's aunt and her husband, who had defected to the United States, told him that a song praising Kim Jong Un was played and that Kim Jong Il said Kim Jong Un was his successor on his son's 8th birthday.",
            "\"Kim Jong Un may have his daughter, who resembles him the most in his mind, as his successor,\" Cheong said.",
            "By",
            "It was only in 2010 when Kim, then 26, was first publicly mentioned in state media as he took a spate of top posts before he inherited power upon his father Kim Jong Il's death the next year. Kim Jong Il was also 31 when he won a key post in the ruling Workers' Party in 1973 \u2014 an appointment seen as a key step in the path to succeeding his father Kim Il Sung. Kim Jong Il's position as successor was made public at the party congress in 1980.",
            "Sponsor Message",
            "It's the first time for North Korea's state media to mention the daughter or publicize her photos. KCNA didn't provide further details about her like her name and age.",
            "When he disappeared from public eye for an extended period in 2020 amid unconfirmed rumors about health conditions, global media frenzy flared over who was next in line to run an impoverished yet nuclear-armed country. Many observers said at the time that Kim's younger sister, Kim Yo Jong, would step in and run the country if her brother was incapacitated.",

            "Paul and Maggie's death also led the state's top law enforcement agency to open an investigation into the 2015 death of teenager Stephen Smith, who was found dead in the middle of a rural road in Hampton County in 2015, three miles from where his car had run out of gas. Authorities have not explained why they reopened the investigation.",
            "The Murdaugh story, which is on the cover of this week's PEOPLE, continues to fascinate people across the country -- but in the small town of Islandton, South Carolina, people are starting to realize that the Murdaugh's storied life was all a facade.",
            "Though Alex survived the gunshot, he soon announced a two-decade addiction to opioids and entered rehab at an undisclosed location out of state. At the same time, his law firm announced that he had been fired for allegedly misappropriating millions of dollars from their accounts.",

            "in Hampton County, South Carolina.",
            "Now, Murdaugh is out of a job, allegedly broke, charged with conspiracy and fraud for a botched suicide attempt and facing new investigations\u2014one into the money missing from his family law firm and another related to the mysterious 2018 death of his longtime housekeeper.",
            "There are still questions about a 2019 boat crash that killed one of Paul Murdaugh's passengers, Mallory Beach. Investigators concluded that the teens were \"grossly intoxicated.\" He pleaded not guilty to three felony counts of boating under the influence and was awaiting trial at the time of his death.",
